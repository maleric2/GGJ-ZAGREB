High Detail Dream Catcher***

In some Native American cultures, this hand-made object originating with the Ojibwe peoples, is often carefully decorated with beads and feathers, and is said to symbolize unity among the tribes.  In modern culture, when hung above a bed, is said to mystically protect the unconscious mind from bad dreams or nightmares, by trapping the "good" dreams in the web, where they slide down the feathers into the sleeping person.

This highly detailed model is available as a native 3dsmax 2012 scene file (.max), and also in several scaled .obj formats, for importing easily into other applications, like Blender, Poser, or Daz|Studio. The .max scene file contains the object in a group, but all parts are easily accessed individually when you ungroup.  This Dream Cather model comes complete with high-res COLOR and BUMP texture maps, where needed.  All textures are .jpg format, and suitable for high quality, close-up rendering.  The topology of the model is 100% quads (quadrilateral faces), with a detailed, but optimized poly count of 65,892 total polygons, and 70,485 verts.  There are absolutely no triangles or Ngons in this model, and no overlapping UV's.  All parts of the model contain UV coordinates, but not all the parts require a texture map.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit for your own projects or scenes; it's great as a decoration in a room, or as an unusual character prop.  The model can be used for both commercial and non commercial renders. You may not, however, resell these objects, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ users: the POSER-specific OBJ version was exported with a scale conversion that should load with the appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above. To ensure proper import into Poser, BE SURE to DE-select all check box options boxes in the Import Options dialogue. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place on Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. options in the import dialogue box after you select the poser .obj file, and then the object should load with correct scale into the scene.  In DAZ|STUDIO, simply choose the Poser-scaled .obj version, and import with Poser Preset option from the import dialogue box.  BLENDER users, obviously, choose the Blender scaled .obj.  All other software applications may be best suited to import the standard .obj file.

All textures were created by me, but most of the original reference textures were from CGTextures.com texture resource website, as well as other free texture repositories in some cases.

Have fun, and let me know if there are any issues:  luxxeon@zoho.com
